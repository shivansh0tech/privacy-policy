    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/11/2025
    </p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Shivansh Tech</strong> collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile applications. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding the limited data we process through integrated third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information Collected (Through Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <p>
        While our core applications do not collect or store data directly on our own servers, we utilize essential third-party services for functionality and monetization, which process certain data:
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Google Authentication (Firebase)</h3>
    <p>
        If you choose to use the "Sign in with Google" feature, we use <strong>Google Firebase Authentication</strong> to facilitate the login process.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Type of Data Processed:** When you sign in, Firebase securely receives and processes your **Google User ID**, **name**, and **email address** to verify your identity and manage your session.</li>
        <li>**Purpose:** This data is used solely to authenticate your account and personalize your in-app experience. **We do not store or manage your login credentials ourselves.**</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>
        Our applications are monetized by displaying advertisements through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob collects and processes data to serve relevant ads and measure their effectiveness.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Type of Data Processed:** AdMob may collect data such as your **device identifiers** (e.g., Advertising ID), **IP address**, **device type**, and **information related to your interaction with ads** (impressions, clicks).</li>
        <li>**Purpose:** This data is processed by Google to contextualize and target advertising, limit the number of times you see a particular ad, and measure the performance of ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
        **Opt-Out/Control:** You can usually control the use of your device's Advertising ID for interest-based advertising through your device's operating system settings (e.g., "Reset Advertising ID" or "Opt-out of Ads Personalization").
    </div>

    <h2>2. How We Use and Share Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Authentication:** We use the data processed via Firebase only to authenticate you and manage your application session.</li>
        <li>**Advertising:** Data is processed by Google AdMob for the purpose of serving personalized and non-personalized advertisements, which is necessary to offer our applications for free.</li>
        <li>**Data Sharing:** We do not directly share any information collected by these third parties, but the services themselves (Google Firebase and Google AdMob) process and may share data in accordance with their own privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our applications are intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently processed information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
    <p>
        Please note that the third-party services we use have their own privacy policies governing their collection and use of data. We recommend reviewing them:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Google Privacy Policy (Firebase & AdMob):** [Insert Link to Google's Privacy Policy]</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
